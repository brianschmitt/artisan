# SR900 roaster BLE driver, built on Artisan's ClientBLE (see ble_port.py).
#
# Frames are fixed 34 byte messages with a trailing checksum over bytes 1..30.
# After connecting, a MAC address request is sent; its response carries the MAC
# from which the per-connection command token is derived. Until that token is
# known the roaster ignores all commands, thus commands issued before the
# handshake completed are queued and flushed once the token arrives.
#
# NOTE on threading: ClientBLE runs the connect/keep alive loop and the loop that
# dispatches the notifications on two different threads, and a write is scheduled
# on the notification loop while the caller blocks waiting for it. Writing from
# notify_callback() thus blocks the very loop that has to carry out the write and
# ends in a BLE timeout 5s later. Everything the handshake response triggers is for
# that reason deferred to heartbeat(), which runs on the other loop.
#
# Control model: MANUAL roast. The fan/heat sliders map to FAN_SET/HEAT_SET
# (levels 0..9) while START carries the firmware roast and cool timers, in minutes.
#
# Ending a roast takes two commands on this roaster, and the machine defaults put them
# on the two Artisan events that mean the same thing:
#   DROP     -> sr900(cool), COOL_DN, which runs the cooling cycle. The roaster keeps
#               reporting ROASTING throughout, see processData()
#   COOL END -> sr900(stop), STOP_ROAST, which returns it to idle once the beans are cool
#               enough for the roaster to accept it, see STOP_RETRY_TICKS
# OFF issues the stop too, so that a heater or fan is never left running unsupervised. A stop
# refused there cannot be retried, the client being torn down right after, but the refusal
# means the roaster is still cooling, which is the safe state to leave it in.
# The firmware roast timer is thus only a backstop and a long roast time is wanted. The
# roaster imposes one rule on it, established by testing against hardware: a roast time
# above 10 minutes is accepted only while the auto stop below is armed, a START carrying
# a longer time with the auto stop OFF being ignored without any response. With it armed
# 15 and even 20 minutes start, and the cool time does not enter into it. Both timers are
# settable via sr900(roasttime,<minutes>) and sr900(cooltime,<minutes>).
#
# A *profile* roast should be run logging-only, as the firmware reasserts its schedule
# every minute and would revert any slider writes, thus PROFILE_ROAST/SEND_PROFILE are
# intentionally not implemented. Neither are ROAST_SET/COOLTIME_SET, which apply only
# before a roast started, the START message carrying the same two timers anyway.
#
# The auto stop ends the roast at a fixed bean temperature (see AUTO_STOP_TEMP), carried
# by byte 17 of START. It is armed at the highest target on offer,
# both because it is the runaway backstop and because the roast timer above depends on it,
# and sr900(autostop,<T>) changes it. Being a code interpreted by the roaster it needs no
# unit conversion, unlike an Artisan alarm, whose limit a machine setup file could only
# ship in one of the two temperature modes.
#
# Temperatures are reported in Fahrenheit. A status frame carries three fields, which
# are two sensors and a selector:
#  * bytes 17/18, the EXTERNAL probe, inserted through the side into the bean mass,
#    hence BT.
#  * bytes 19/20, the INTERNAL sensor sitting in the base next to the heating element.
#    Under heat it rises ~35F in 8s and peaks the very sample the element switches off,
#    while the external probe lags and keeps climbing after, so this is a fast air
#    temperature next to the element, hence ET. It reads a few degrees above the
#    external probe at idle.
#  * bytes 15/16, whichever of the two the roaster settings select, +64 in the settings
#    byte selecting EXTERNAL. This field only ever mirrors one of the other two and
#    follows the selection as it changes. The driver reads the two sensors directly and
#    ignores it, so that BT is the bean probe whatever the roaster happens to be set to.
# Both are reported as received, without clamping or substituting missing readings.
#
# NOTE: every message here is confirmed against hardware but for FAN_SET, whose frame
# layout mirrors HEAT_SET.
